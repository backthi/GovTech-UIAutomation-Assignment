  "rationaleForProjectionsEdit": "A grant is a quantity of money, i.e., financial assistance, given by a government, organization, or person for a specific purpose. Unlike a loan, you do not have to pay back the money. In some cases, the receivers of study grants who abandoned their courses have to pay back the money.",
